generalflowjoyplot.r

Using USGS dataRetrieval interface, create joyplot of arbitrary USGS streamgauge daily discharge. This can provide insights into changes in streamflow seasonality over time, because of climate variability, climate change, and human interventions (dam operations, for example).

User inputs include gauge number and a "scale" factor that governs the relative height of the plots. "3" is a sane starting points. Larger numbers are needed to highlight highly variable systems.
